Some job for Captain Obvious
```
client/           // Cleint side files
node_modules/     // Node dependencies
server/           // Server side files
```

## Client folder structure

```
app/          // Angular app files
build/        // Minified concatenated assets generated by gulp
styles/       // Your general scss files which will includes in main entry for application scss
vendor/       // Bower_components folder
main.js       // Main entry for angular app js
main.scss     // Main entry for application scss
vendor.js     // Main entry for vendor js (you can require both node_modules and bower packages from it).
vendor.scss   // Main entry for vendor css (if you have an external package with css or scss - include it here).
```

## Angular Folder structure
```
app/
  components/               // Single angular components (like pages)

      home-controller.js        // Controller for component
      home-view.html            // View for component
      index.js                  // Component module which contains all component parts (controller, directives, services, etc..)
    index.js                  // Angular module which contains all components modules
  shared/                   // Angular components shared through application (like header, sidebar, etc..)
    header/                   // Folder for shared module
      header-directive.js       // Directive for shared module
      header-ivew.html          // View for shared module
      index.js                  // Angular module which contains all shared modules
    index.js                  // Angular module which contains all shared modules
  app.modules.js            // Basic angular application settings
  app.routes.js             // Angular routing
